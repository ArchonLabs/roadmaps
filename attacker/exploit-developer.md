# Summary

Exploit in cyber security refer to software, script, chunk of data, or sequence of commands that take advantage of vulnerabilities to alter behavior of target. 

Exploit developer is researching vulnerability by finding and abusing it to gain advantage from disclose information to take over target.

# Hard Skills

- Understanding low level code (assembly), processor architecture (x86, ARM, etc), and memory model (stack, heap).
- Understanding memory corruption concept.
- Understanding modern security mitigations (stack cookies, SafeSEH, DEP, ASLR, CFG, etc) and how to bypass it.
- Understanding OS internals and low level part.
- Experience in reverse engineering.
- Experience in binary analysis (fuzzing, debugging, instrumentation).
- Experience in system emulation.
- Experience in system programming (C/C++)

# Soft Skills
