# Summary

Adversarial Engineering, also known as Red Team Exercise, performs adversarial threat simulation activities and simulate realistic conditions of attack by a live adversary. Adversarial engineering develop scenario or replicate TTP of real threat actor.

# Hard Skills

- Familiarity with industry standard such as MITRE ATT&CK.
- Familiarity with Cyber Kill Chain.
- Experience in binary exploitation.
- Experience in web application development and system administration.
- Understanding OPSEC (operational security) and covert operation.
- Able to read threat intelligence report and extract key techniques used by threat actors.
- Able to develop payloads, scripts, and tools that weaponize new concept for execution, evasion, lateral movement, and persistence.
- Able to simulate/emulate Tactics, Techniques, and Procedure (TTP).
- Experience in post exploitation tools

# Soft Skills
